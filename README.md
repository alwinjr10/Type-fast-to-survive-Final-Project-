During this project, I came across several challenges, such as adding a live countdown timer, adjusting or resizingÂ images, and choosing what type of game to create. Because I had only a few ideas in mind at first, I also had trouble coming up with sentences for the game. Also, I had an issue with colors while doing this on Ren'Py because I wrote the code in normal color name way, but Ren'Py was having an issue reading it, so I had to change that into a hexadecimal color code, which Ren'Py could read. Even though I had all of these challenges, I gained a lot of understanding of how to solve problems and apply different functions, such as image modifications, a countdown timer, and more. Having a friend to help me with my challenges and using trial and error helped me to overcome the difficulties I faced. Solving these challenges and seeing the project's completion was exciting because I never thought I would make a game, even though it's very small. I enjoyed creating something of my own and adapting my creative ideas into complex coding. I had a great time creating something interactive and gaining some knowledge about coding in the process of making this small game.
